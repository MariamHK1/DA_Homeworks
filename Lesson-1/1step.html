				  <h2>Cappuccino</h2>
				  <p>A cappuccino is the traditional Italian blend of 1/3 espresso, 1/3 steamed milk and 1/3 stiff milk froth on top. When drinking a cappuccino, you experience the foam first and then the rich milky coffee.</p>
				</article>

				  <h2> Latte </h2>
				  <p>Many people think a latte is a milkier cappuccino, but it’s more complex than that. A latte, our most popular coffee, is made from textured milk into which is poured a single shot of espresso. It’s served in a glass and has a thin layer of milk microfoam on top.</p>

				  <h2>Flat White</h2>
				  <p>The basic ingredients of a flat white are similar to a latte and a cappuccino but the difference is the texture of the milk and the amount of espresso (double shot). The milk is steamed and poured from the bottom of the jug, holding back the froth on the top of the milk. This creates a velvety and smooth cup of coffee.</p>

				  <h2>Mocha</h2>
				  <p>A mocha is a mix between a cappuccino and a hot chocolate. It’s made with a combination of chocolate powder and a shot of espresso, topped with steamed milk and a layer of 
				  microfoam. We find Mocha is always a popular drink in the winter.</p>

				</article>
				<article class="browser"> 
					<h2> Espresso </h2>
					<p> For a quick caffeine fix, an espresso is the way to go! Espresso is a full-flavoured, concentrated form of coffee made by forcing pressurised, hot water through very finely ground coffee beans. An espresso is a short coffee drink served in single or double shots. </p>
